<h2> A story i wrote back in the day  </h2>
<h2> The high school prom was in full swing as my friends and I enjoyed ourselves, hoping to have a memorable night. However, our hopes were crushed when we caught the attention of the notorious school bullies. We were always on guard around them, knowing they would make our lives miserable. Unfortunately, they spotted us almost immediately, and despite our attempts to walk away, they quickly caught up and dragged us into an empty room. Silence enveloped the room as we sat there, the distant sound of music from the gym barely reaching our ears. Alice, the ringleader of the bullies, finally broke the silence with a sneer. So, you thought you could escape us, huh? she taunted. Well, think again. You dorks are spending the rest of prom with us. Without any hesitation, each girl grabbed a boy and left the room, leaving only Alice and me behind. As I moved towards the door, she blocked my path and placed her hand firmly on my chest. Where do you think you're going, fuckface? she growled. We're not done here. I tried to reason with her, mentioning her boyfriend, but she dismissed him with a wave of her hand. Not anymore. I dumped that jerk, and now I get to have fun with you. Slowly, she lifted my shirt, but I instinctively grabbed her hands and pushed them away. Undeterred, she grasped the sides of my bare stomach, sending shivers down my spine. Just let mommy play with her boy toy, she whispered seductively into my ear. Her hand trailed down my stomach, stopping at my waist. You need to be a good boy, but I can't trust you just yet. With one hand, she pinned both of my wrists against the wall above my head, rendering me helpless. I struggled against her grip, but she found it amusing. Look at my little pretty boy, so vulnerable and defenseless, she taunted. Leaning in, she kissed my forehead and slipped her other hand into my pants, teasingly stroking me. Her lips grazed my neck, knowing my weakness for neck kisses. Despite my efforts to resist, the sensation of her lip gloss-covered lips on my skin was too incredible to ignore. I grew hard under her touch, and she reveled in my response. Ah, there we go. Finally some action from my little peanut, she smirked. As the shortest guy in school, I despised any remarks about my height, especially from someone like her. Filled with a mix of anger and arousal, I muttered, Don't call me that. Like a predator sensing its prey, she pounced on the opportunity. Oh, what was that, shortstack? I'll call you a little peanut all I want, she teased, her voice dripping with dominance. Because I own you now. Her touch made my cock throb, and I was on the verge of exploding. My legs weakened, but her grip on my wrists kept me upright. Just when I thought I couldn't hold on any longer, she released me, causing me to collapse to the ground. It took a moment for my senses to return, and when they did, I found myself staring up at Alice. She looked down at me, a smug expression on her face, having thoroughly taken advantage of me. Leaning close, she warned, You breathe a word of this to anyone, and I'll do much worse than tease you, bitch boy. She sauntered towards the door, adjusting her appearance with a self-satisfied air. Before leaving, she glanced back at me and declared, Hurry up and compose yourself. This won't be the only time something like this happens tonight. With that, she disappeared into the other area, leaving me disgusted, horny, and utterly exhausted. As I laid there, trying to process what had just happened, my mind raced with thoughts of why Alice behaved the way she did. Rumors had always circulated around school about her dark past and troubled home life. Some said she was abused by her stepfather, while others whispered about her involvement in a gang. I couldn't help but wonder if any of it was true and if that's what led her to become the bully she was. But as I pondered these things, I couldn't deny the intense arousal that lingered within me. Despite the fear and anger I felt towards Alice, a part of me couldn't help but crave her dominance. It was a dangerous and confusing mix of emotions, but I couldn't deny the fact that I wanted more. As the night went on, I found myself drawn to Alice, unable to resist her allure. And each time we were alone, she took control, leaving me breathless and wanting more. It was like a game between us, a dangerous dance of power and desire. And I couldn't help but wonder if it would ever end, or if we were both caught in a cycle of pleasure and pain. In the end, prom night was a blur of tangled limbs and forbidden desires. And while I knew it was wrong, I couldn't bring myself to regret it. For in that one night, I had experienced a level of passion and submission that I never knew existed. And as the years passed, I couldn't help but wonder if Alice felt the same, if she too was caught in the endless cycle of lust and dominance. </h2>
