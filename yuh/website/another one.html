<h2>Another story I wrote in my young days </h2>
<h2> Nathen walked into the bar, his short and small-framed body standing out among the crowd. He had a cute face and a thick ass that would make anyone's mouth water. He was used to getting attention, and tonight was no different. As he made his way to the bar, he noticed a tall, muscular woman named Ivy. She had dark hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through him. Her body was toned and her thighs were thick, even more than his. Nathen couldn't help but feel drawn to her, a primal desire stirring within him. He took a seat at the bar and ordered a drink, trying to calm his racing heart. Ivy approached him, her eyes scanning his body hungrily. She whispered in his ear, I like your curves, cutie. Nathen blushed and smiled, feeling a surge of excitement at her boldness. They started chatting and flirting, their bodies leaning closer and closer. As the night went on, they continued to drink and flirt, the sexual tension between them becoming more and more intense. Finally, Ivy leaned in close and whispered, Do you want to come back to my place? Without hesitation, Nathen nodded and followed Ivy out of the bar and into her car. Once they arrived at her place, Ivy wasted no time in showing Nathen just how dominant she could be. She pushed him against the wall, her lips crashing onto his in a heated kiss. He moaned into her mouth, his body responding to her touch. Ivy's hands roamed all over his body, exploring every inch of him. She could tell he was enjoying it, his body trembling under her touch. But Ivy had a surprise for Nathen. As she pushed him onto the bed and began to undress, he noticed that she had a large, throbbing member between her legs. He couldn't believe it, he had never been with a futa before. Ivy could see the shock on Nathen's face but she didn't let it faze her. She climbed on top of him, straddling his hips and positioning herself at his entrance. Are you ready for me, cutie? she asked, a hungry look in her eyes. He nodded, unable to speak as she slowly pushed herself inside him. He gasped at the feeling, his body adjusting to her size. she slowly began to move, her hips thrusting in a steady rhythm. He couldn't believe how amazing it felt, his body responding to every movement. As Ivy picked up her pace, he couldn't hold back any longer. He moaned and writhed beneath her, his body trembling with pleasure as she brought him to the brink of ecstasy. With one final thrust, they both reached their climax, their bodies trembling and collapsing onto the bed. As they lay there, catching their breath, Nathen couldn't believe what had just happened. He had never experienced anything like it before. Fuck, that was unbelievable, he said, still in a daze. Ivy chuckled and kissed his forehead. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can do it again sometime. Nathen smiled, and slowly feel into a deep sleep, excited for the next day with his new found lover.
