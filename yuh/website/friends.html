<h1> A story i wrote back in the day  </h1>
<h1> This all started at the high school prom. Me and the boys were just minding our business when “THEY” saw us. They were the school bullies and we were always their prime targets so we were constantly on the lookout for them. But somehow they noticed us almost immediately even though we were hoping they wouldn’t. We tried to turn around and walk away but they caught up and dragged us all into an empty room. We sat there in silence for what seemed like forever while the muffled music from the gym was the only thing we could hear. The one to break the endless silence was Alice, she was the biggest bully in school. And I was  always on the top of her hit list but she’s been acting kinda different lately. “So you thought you could get away from us just like that huh?” “Well think again because just for that you dorks are spending the rest of prom with us.” After a few second of everyone looking at each other each girl made their way over, grabbed a boy and walked out, leaving only me and Alice behind, but when I started to walk towards the door Alice stood in my way and put her hand on my chest. “And just where do you think you’re going fuckface, we’re not done here”.  “What do you mean, you gonna torture me again like you always do?” “Just shut up and kiss me” Hearing those words come out of her mouth startled me, I thought she was joking so I backed up but she followed almost every step I took until I was backed against a wall with her body rubbing against mine, she took this opportunity and grabbed the back of my head and kissed me for what seemed like ages. When she pulled back I was almost breathless but I was able to muster some energy to get out a few words.“What are you doing, don’t you have a boyfriend?” I tried to reason with her but she wouldn’t budge. “Not anymore I dumped that jerk, and now I get to have fun with you.” She started to lift my shirt but I grabbed her hands and pushed them back but she wrapped her hands around the sides of my bare stomach and whispered in my ear, sending shivers through my whole body. “Just let mommy play with her boy toy”.  She took her hand and traced her way down my stomach until she got down to my waist and stopped. “I’m gonna need you to be a good boy but, I can’t trust you to stay still just yet.” She then took one hand and grabbed both of my wrists and held them against the walls above my head and I couldn’t help but struggle. “Awe look at my little pretty boy, all helpless and defenseless, you look so cute baby.” She kissed the top of my forehead and took her other free hand and  stuck it down into my pants and slowly started stoking. She leaned down by my ear and looked me in my eyes and proceeded to kiss and suck on my neck. She knew I've always had a thing for neck kisses so she knew how I would react, so I tried my best to fight my urges but the feeling of her lip gloss covered lips on my skin felt so amazing on my skin I just couldn’t help but get hard. “Oh, there we go finally some action from my little peanut”. I was always known as the shortest guy in school so I could never stand anyone talking about my height, especially someone like her so in a small fit of anger I mumbled “Don’t call me that.” And just like a moth to a flame she knew what I was going to say, so she knew how to react. “Oh, what was that shortstack, I’ll call you a little peanut all I want”. She leaned in close “Cause I own you now”. I felt my cock throb in her hands, just from her talking I was almost about to explode. My legs went weak but her hand was still holding me up by my wrists, and right when I was about to let go of it all she pulled back and let go of me, causing my weak knees to get the better of me and me falling to the ground. It took me a second to get my thoughts together, but when I did I looked up and there she was, standing over me. She looked so smug, having taken advantage of me. She leaned down next to me. “You tell anyone about this I’ll do much worse than edge you bitch boy”.  She got up and walked toward the door while straightening herself and her hair, when she got to the door she took one last look at me and spoke. “Hurry up and get yourself together, that’s not the only time something like that is happening to you tonight.” She turned and left the room back in to the other area and just left me there disgusted with myself, horny out of my mind and tired as all hell. But I was still able to get myself together in a minute or 2 and continue enjoying my prom night, and she wasn’t wrong we did do shit like that another 2 or 3 times that night.
